# Chess
C++ Chess Game
This project is a console-based Chess game implemented in C++. It is designed to offer a full chess-playing experience, including movement rules, check, and checkmate. This was my final project in my object-oriented programming class at the end of my freshman year. 

## Features
Loading Screen: Either choose to start or exit.

Two-Player Mode: Allows two players to compete against each other.

Standard Rules: Implements all standard chess rules. 

Move Validation: Ensures that moves are legal according to chess rules.

Game Status: Tracks check, checkmate, piece capturing, and player turns.

Colors and Unicode Characters: Used colors to show if you are in check, also for tiles of board (green/white). Unicode characters for black/white pieces. 

## The project is implemented using
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes for piece movement, tiles, and board. Chose to implement it where each tile on the board can take attribute of being a piece. 

Multithreading: Utilized for the cursor to make it change shape so that it has the effect of looking like it is moving. Also implemented for the board so that there is a brief pause after each move, preventing potential timing issues in the board's operation

## Future Goals
~ Add an AI opponent for single-player mode.

~ Implement En Passant and Castling.

~ Make game more visually pleasing.

~ GUI interface.
